# Supplement Store Setup Instructions

## Database Setup

To complete the supplement store implementation, you need to run the supplements schema in your Supabase database:

### Step 1: Access Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to the SQL Editor

### Step 2: Run the Supplements Schema
1. Copy the contents of `database/supplements_schema.sql`
2. Paste it into the SQL Editor
3. Click "Run" to execute the SQL

This will:
- Create the `supplements` table with all required fields
- Add performance indexes
- Insert 5 sample supplements (Whey Protein, Creatine, BCAA, Multivitamin, Pre-Workout)

### Step 3: Verify Setup
After running the SQL, you should see:
- A new `supplements` table in your database
- 5 sample supplement records
- Proper indexes for performance
