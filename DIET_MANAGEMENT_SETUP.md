# Diet Management System Setup Instructions

## Database Setup

To complete the diet management system implementation, you need to run the diet plans schema in your Supabase database:

### Step 1: Access Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to the SQL Editor

### Step 2: Run the Diet Plans Schema
1. Copy the contents of `database/diet_plans_schema.sql`
2. Paste it into the SQL Editor
3. Click "Run" to execute the SQL

This will:
- Create the `diet_plans` table with comprehensive nutrition data
- Create the `member_diet_assignments` table for tracking assignments
- Add performance indexes
- Insert 3 comprehensive diet plans (Fat Loss, Muscle Gain, Weight Gain)

### Step 3: Verify Setup
After running the SQL, you should see:
- A new `diet_plans` table with 3 diet plans
- A new `member_diet_assignments` table for tracking assignments
- Proper indexes for performance
